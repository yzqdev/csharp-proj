# WPFSpark v1.5 Released (Dec 31, 2020)
This release can now be used with dotnet core 3.1 and 5.0 apps.

The nuget package can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WPFSpark/1.5.0)

## About WPFSpark
**WPFSpark** project was started by me in December 2009, with the aim of creating a library of rich user controls which can be used by the developer community. Initially, I ported the Circular Progress Control (which I had developed using C# and GDI+) to WPF. Eventually, as I gained more experience in WPF, I added more controls.

**WPFSpark v1.0** was released in December 2011 followed by **WPFSpark v1.1** in January 2012. Now, after a really long gap of nearly 4 years, I am happy to announce that the next version of WPFSpark is finally released. :) It has been ported to **.NET 4.6** using **C# 6.0**.

### ClipBorder
**ClipBorder** is similar to to **Border** class with an additional feature. It clips its content within its boundaries. It derives from the **Decorator** class and provides the same dependency properties as the **Border** class. You can set the `CornerRadius` property of the **ClipBorder** to obtain a Rounded Rectangular clip. **ClipBorder** powers the **ToggleSwitch** control.

### SprocketControl
**SprocketControl** is a circular progress control similar to the Asynchronous Circular Progress Indicator in Mac OS X. It can behave as either normal or indeterminate progress control.

### ToggleSwitch

**ToggleSwitch** control derives from **ToggleButton** and supports only two states: `True` or `False`. This control has been completely rewritten from scratch and provides many properties which allow the user to customize the look and feel of the control (e.g. Windows 10 mobile style or iOS style). Users can create their own customized styles.

### FluidWrapPanel
**FluidWrapPanel** is another control which derives from **Panel** and provides the functionality of a WrapPanel with an added advantage - *the child elements of the panel can be easily rearranged by simple drag and drop*. It has been rewritten from scratch to accommodate children of non-uniform size.
